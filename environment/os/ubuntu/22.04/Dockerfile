# Mimic a minimal Ubuntu 22.04 cloud server image (e.g. DigitalOcean, AWS EC2,
# GCP Compute Engine). Only packages that cloud providers include by default:
#   curl + ca-certificates — almost universally pre-installed on cloud images
#   git                   — commonly included; useful for cloning the repo
# Nothing else. No Node, no PHP, no Composer — lakeup must handle everything.
