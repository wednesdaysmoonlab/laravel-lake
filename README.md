**Your machine. Zero PHP. Full Laravel.**

Lake is a zero-dependency Laravel bootstrap powered by [FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev) — a single binary that is the web server, the PHP runtime, and the CLI all at once. No Docker images to pull, no Homebrew formulas to install, no `phpenv` headaches.

Drop `lakeup` in a folder, run it, answer a few questions about your stack, and walk away with a production-ready Laravel app.

---

## Overview

`lakeup` bootstraps a full Laravel project in the current directory by:

1. Downloading the FrankenPHP binary for your OS and architecture
2. Installing Composer (as a PHAR, no global install needed)
3. Installing `laravel/installer` — enabling interactive stack selection
4. Running `laravel new` to create the project with your chosen stack (Livewire, Inertia, Breeze, etc.)
5. Patching the `composer run dev` script to use FrankenPHP as the web server
6. Configuring `.env`, running migrations, and setting permissions

All binaries and tools are isolated inside `.lake/` and excluded from git.

---

## Who Is Lake For?

### Beginners — Just Start Building

Never set up PHP before? Never touched Composer or Docker? That is completely fine.

Lake asks nothing of your machine. One command downloads everything it needs and hands you a running Laravel app. No tutorials about environment setup. No forum posts about broken Homebrew formulas. No version conflicts with whatever else is on your system.

This also makes Lake a natural entry point if you come from **Node.js, Python, Ruby, or any other language** and want to explore the PHP world — you get a modern, production-grade stack without paying the PHP setup tax first.

> `curl` the script, run it, start coding.

### Mid-level Developers — Move Fast Without Cutting Corners

You know what you want to build. Lake gets out of your way and lets you build it.

- Pick your stack interactively — Livewire, Inertia/React, Inertia/Vue, Breeze, or plain — on first run.
- All standard Laravel workflows work as expected: `artisan`, `composer`, tests, queues, Vite HMR.
- Every environment is identical — `.lake/` is self-contained, so your laptop, a teammate's laptop, and a CI runner all run the same binary against the same app.
- Switching projects means switching directories — no global version managers, no `phpenv use`, no Docker context switching.

### Senior Developers — Sane Defaults, Zero Ceremony

Lake is opinionated where opinions matter and invisible everywhere else.

- **Production parity in dev** — FrankenPHP is the same binary in both environments. No more "works on `php -S`, breaks on nginx."
- **Instant onboarding** — new team members drop `lakeup` in their clone and are running in minutes, not hours.
- **Reproducible by design** — pin `FRANKEN_VERSION` in CI, commit the `Caddyfile`, done. No surprise upgrades.
- **No global footprint** — Lake never touches system PHP, Homebrew, or global Composer. It cannot break other projects.
- **FrankenPHP features available out of the box** — early hints, Zstandard compression, native modules — without any custom server configuration.

---

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux (x86_64 or arm64)
- `curl`
- `node` / `npm` (for frontend assets)

No PHP, no Composer, no Docker needed on the host machine.

---

## Getting Started

Create an empty directory for your project, then download and run `lakeup` inside it:

```bash
mkdir my-app
cd my-app
curl -fsSL https://github.com/wednesdaysmoonlab/lake/releases/latest/download/lakeup -o lakeup
chmod +x lakeup
./lakeup
```

You will be prompted for:

- **Dev server port** — default `8090`, press Enter to accept

Then `laravel new` starts and asks you to choose:

- Starter kit (None, Livewire, Inertia/React, Inertia/Vue, etc.)
- Authentication provider
- Testing framework (Pest / PHPUnit)
- Other stack options

### 3. Start the dev server

```bash
.lake/composer run dev
```

This starts all services concurrently:

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **server** | FrankenPHP (reads `Caddyfile`) |
| **queue** | `artisan queue:listen` |
| **logs** | `artisan pail` (log viewer) |
| **vite** | Vite dev server with HMR |

Open your browser at `http://localhost:8090` (or your chosen port).

---

## Daily Usage

### Artisan

```bash
.lake/php artisan make:model Post -m
.lake/php artisan migrate
.lake/php artisan tinker
```

### Composer

```bash
.lake/composer require livewire/livewire
.lake/composer install
```

### Run dev server

```bash
.lake/composer run dev
```

### Run tests

```bash
.lake/composer run test
```

---

## Environment Overrides

You can skip prompts by passing environment variables:

```bash
# Pin a specific FrankenPHP version and set port without being asked
FRANKEN_VERSION=1.11.2 LAKE_PORT=9000 ./lakeup
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `FRANKEN_VERSION` | `latest` | FrankenPHP release to download |
| `LAKE_PORT` | prompt (default `8090`) | Dev server port |

---

## Commands

```bash
./lakeup help      # Show usage
./lakeup version   # Show lakeup and Laravel versions
./lakeup purge     # Remove everything except lakeup and .claude
./lakeup clean     # Remove Laravel files only, keep .lake/ (faster reinstall)
./lakeup update    # Update lakeup to the latest release
```

### `version`

```bash
./lakeup version
```

Prints the current version of `lakeup` and the installed Laravel version (read from `composer.lock` — no PHP required).

```
✦ lakeup v0.2.1
✦ Laravel v12.4.0
```

### `purge` vs `clean`

| Command | Keeps | Removes |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `purge` | `lakeup`, `.claude` | Everything including `.lake/` |
| `clean` | `lakeup`, `.claude`, `.lake/` | All Laravel app files |

Use `clean` when you want to start a fresh Laravel install without re-downloading FrankenPHP and Composer (~170 MB).

```bash
./lakeup clean
./lakeup
```

## How It Works

### FrankenPHP as the web server

FrankenPHP embeds PHP and the Caddy web server into a single binary. `lakeup` creates a `Caddyfile` that routes all requests through `index.php`:

```caddy
{
    frankenphp
    order php_server before file_server
}

http://localhost:8090 {
    root * public
    php_server
}
```

### PHP and Composer shims

Because Composer passes `-d` flags when calling PHP (e.g. `-d allow_url_fopen=1`), and FrankenPHP's `php-cli` mode doesn't support them, `.lake/php` strips those flags before delegating to FrankenPHP.

### Dev script patch

Laravel's default `composer run dev` uses `php artisan serve` (PHP's built-in `-S` web server). `lakeup` automatically patches `composer.json` to replace it with `.lake/frankenphp run`, which uses the Caddyfile instead.

---

## Known Limitations

- **`php artisan serve`** — Not supported. Use `.lake/frankenphp run` or `composer run dev` instead.
- **Global PHP/Composer** — The `.lake/` shims are project-local. They do not affect any system-installed PHP or Composer.

### PHP_BINARY auto-patcher

FrankenPHP's php-cli mode leaves the `PHP_BINARY` PHP constant as an empty string. Packages that pass this constant directly to `Symfony\Process` (e.g. Laravel Boost, PHPUnit, Collision) would fail with `ValueError: First element must contain a non-empty program name`.

Lake handles this automatically:

1. **`.lake/php` shim** — exports the `PHP_BINARY` environment variable pointing to itself, so `Symfony\PhpExecutableFinder` resolves correctly.
2. **`.lake/fix-php-binary`** — a Composer `post-autoload-dump` hook that patches vendor files using direct `PHP_BINARY` constant references to fall back to the environment variable:
   ```php
   // Before
   PHP_BINARY
   // After
   (getenv('PHP_BINARY') ?: (PHP_BINARY ?: 'php'))
   ```
3. The patches are **backwards-compatible** — on standard PHP (where the env var is unset), the expression falls through to the constant, preserving original behavior.
4. The patches are **re-applied automatically** after every `composer install`, `update`, or `require`.
