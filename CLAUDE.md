# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Lake is a single-file bash bootstrap script (`lake.setup`) that provisions a full Laravel + FrankenPHP development environment with zero host-level dependencies (no PHP, no Docker, no Composer required).

## Commands

After running `./lake.setup` once, the project is set up. Daily commands all go through the `.lake/` shims:

```bash
# Bootstrap (run once in an empty directory)
./lake.setup
FRANKEN_VERSION=1.11.2 LAKE_PORT=9000 ./lake.setup   # with overrides

# Start dev server (FrankenPHP + queue worker + log viewer + Vite)
.lake/composer run dev

# Artisan
.lake/php artisan <command>

# Composer
.lake/composer require <package>
.lake/composer install

# Tests
.lake/composer run test

# Reset
./lake.setup purge    # Remove everything except lake.setup and .claude
./lake.setup clean    # Remove Laravel files only; keep .lake/ (~170 MB of binaries)
```

## Architecture

The entire bootstrap logic lives in `lake.setup`. There is no build step — it is a standalone bash script.

**Key design decisions:**

- `.lake/php` is a shim that exports `PHP_BINARY` (pointing to itself) and strips `-d` flags before delegating to `frankenphp php-cli`. The env-var export works around FrankenPHP leaving the `PHP_BINARY` PHP constant empty.
- `.lake/composer` also sets `PHP_BINARY` and prepends `.lake/` to `PATH` before invoking `frankenphp php-cli composer.phar`. This ensures `@php` hooks in Composer scripts resolve to the shim.
- `.lake/fix-php-binary` is a Composer `post-autoload-dump` hook that patches vendor files using `PHP_BINARY` directly (e.g. `[PHP_BINARY, ...]`) to fall back to the env var. This runs automatically on every `composer install/update/require`.
- `laravel new` is run into a temporary subdirectory (`.laravel_setup_tmp/`) and then moved to the project root — because the installer requires an empty directory.
- The `composer.json` dev script is patched post-install: `php artisan serve` → `.lake/frankenphp run` (FrankenPHP uses a `Caddyfile`; it does not support PHP's built-in `-S` server).
- SQLite is the default database. A `database/database.sqlite` file is created and `migrate` is run automatically.

**Known caveat:** The `PHP_BINARY` PHP constant is empty under FrankenPHP php-cli mode. The `.lake/php` shim exports the env var and `.lake/fix-php-binary` patches vendor call-sites on every Composer dump, so packages like Laravel Boost work out of the box.

## Output style

All user-facing messages in `lake.setup` use the `_say` helper instead of plain `echo`:

```bash
_say() { printf '\e[38;5;117m✦\e[0m %s\n' "$*"; }
```

- Color `\e[38;5;117m` is sky blue, matching the ASCII logo palette.
- Use `_say "message"` for every new status/info line added to the script.
- Keep `echo ""` for blank lines and `echo "==="` for decorative separators — those do not use `_say`.
- The `_say` function is defined at the top of the main script body (after the logo), so it is available everywhere including `purge` and `clean` commands.

## Post-install patching

Conditional patches that run after `laravel new` are written **inline in `lake.setup`** as bash + `frankenphp php-cli -r "..."` blocks. Do not introduce external PHP scripts or downloads for these — they must work in a single-file bootstrap (including `curl | bash` installs).

Current inline patches:
- **`.mcp.json` command path** — if `.mcp.json` contains `"command": "php"` (written by packages like `laravel/boost`), the user is prompted to rewrite it to `.lake/php`. Uses `read -rp ... </dev/tty` for reliable interactive input and `frankenphp php-cli -r` for the regex replacement.

**Why not `laravel/prompts` or external scripts?** FrankenPHP php-cli does not pass the TTY through correctly, so `laravel/prompts`' `confirm()` silently falls back to its default without showing a prompt. Direct `/dev/tty` reads in bash are reliable.
